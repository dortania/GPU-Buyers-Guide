# AMD GPUs

## Native AMD GPUs

### **Navi 23 series**

#### Highest Supported OS: Current/Ventura (13)

#### Initial Supported OS: Monterey (12.1)

As of 12.1, Apple has added support for the RX 6600 XT.

Supported Cards:

* RX 6600
* RX 6600 XT

Note: Most Navi 23 cards currently require the boot argument `agdpmod=pikera` to get a display out.

Needed kexts:

* [Lilu.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/Lilu/releases)
* [WhateverGreen.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/WhateverGreen/releases)

### **Navi 21 series**

#### Highest Supported OS: Current/Ventura (13)

#### Initial Supported OS: Big Sur (11.4)

As of 11.4, Apple has added Navi 21 support.

Supported Cards:

* RX 6800
* RX 6800 XT
* RX 6900 XT
  * The XTXH variant (Device ID: `0x73AF`) is supported with WhateverGreen 1.5.2 and spoofing `device-id` to `0x73BF`.

Note: Most Navi 21 cards currently require the boot argument `agdpmod=pikera` to get a display out.

Needed kexts:

* [Lilu.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/Lilu/releases)
* [WhateverGreen.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/WhateverGreen/releases)

### **Navi 10 Series**

#### Highest Supported OS: Current/Ventura (13)

#### Initial Supported OS: Catalina (10.15.1)

Currently, as of 10.15.1, Apple has finally added RDNA and Navi support.

Supported Cards:

* RX 5500
* RX 5500 XT
* RX 5600
* RX 5600 XT
* RX 5700
* RX 5700 XT
* RX 5700 XT 50th Anniversary Edition

Radeon Pro:

* Radeon Pro W5500
* Radeon Pro W5700

Note: Most Navi 10 and 14 cards currently require the boot argument `agdpmod=pikera` to get proper display out.

Needed kexts:

* [Lilu.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/Lilu/releases)
* [WhateverGreen.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/WhateverGreen/releases)

**Important note for MSI Navi users**:

* Catalina (10.15) installers and under currently have a VBIOS bug which crashes installers if an MSI Navi card is present. This can be resolved by injecting `ATY,Rom#` in your GPU's DeviceProperties with any value. See here for more details: [Installer not working with 5700XT #901](https://github.com/acidanthera/bugtracker/issues/901)
* MSI's Polaris and Vega line are not affected by this bug.

### **Vega 20 series**

#### Highest Supported OS: Current/Ventura (13)

#### Initial Supported OS: Mojave (10.14.5)

All Vega based dedicated GPUs are natively supported in macOS with Vega 20 GPUs starting in Mojave.

Supported Cards:

* Radeon VII

Needed kexts:

* [Lilu.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/Lilu/releases)
* [WhateverGreen.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/WhateverGreen/releases)

### **Vega 10 series**

#### Highest Supported OS: Current/Ventura (13)

#### Initial Supported OS: High Sierra (10.13)

Just like with Vega 20, Vega 10 GPUs are natively supported in macOS, though these cards' support starts in High Sierra.

And for those who want to overclock/undervolt, check out [PyVega](https://github.com/corpnewt/PyVega)

The only brand of GPUs to **avoid with Vega 10 is XFX**. The reason is VBIOS communication issues which can't be easily solved with a reference BIOS due to how Vega's powerplay table interacts with the OS and GPU.

Supported Cards:

* Vega 64 Liquid
* Vega 64
* Vega 56

Radeon Pro:

* Vega Frontier Edition
* Radeon Pro WX 9100

Needed kexts:

* [Lilu.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/Lilu/releases)
* [WhateverGreen.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/WhateverGreen/releases)

### **Polaris 10 and 20 series**

#### Highest Supported OS: Current/Ventura (13)

#### Initial Supported OS: Sierra (10.12)

Regarding Polaris, basically every model of card is supported as long as itâ€™s running either a Polaris or Baffin core. Lower end cards like the RX 550 may run a Lexa core, meaning no support in macOS.

The only brands **you should avoid with the Polaris series would be XFX (460/560 models), PowerColor, HIS and VisionTek** as many users have had bootloader and macOS boot issues. Other users have found fixes/workarounds, though nothing consistent. This seems to be caused by having an odd VBIOS that doesn't communicate well with macOS and the only real solution is flashing another VBIOS, which is not ideal for most users.

Supported cards:

400 Series:

* RX 480
* RX 470D
* RX 470
* RX 460

500 Series:

* RX 590
* RX 580X
* RX 580
* RX 570X
* RX 570
* RX 560X
* RX 560
* RX 550 (Baffin core)

Radeon Pro:

* WX 7100
* WX 5100
* WX 4100
* E9550

* [Lilu.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/Lilu/releases)
* [WhateverGreen.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/WhateverGreen/releases)

### **R7/R9**

#### Highest Supported OS: Monterey (12)

#### Initial Supported OS: Yosemite (10.10)

R7/R9 is also natively supported without too much issue, but we cannot guarantee the success of R5 and R7 cards due to few reports of success with them. Also, be wary that differing from the reference design of these cards has many more issues that require a lot of work to get them to run properly. Sapphire cards are your best bet. Also, the R9 280X/380X are hit or miss on compatibility.

Supported cards:
* FirePro W5100 (Fake ID needed)
* R9 Fury X
* R9 Fury
* R9 Nano
* R9 390 (Fake ID needed)
* R9 290X/390X
* R9 290/390 (Fake ID needed)
* R9 280X/380X (Hit or miss)
* R9 280/380 (Fake ID needed)
* R9 270X/370X
* R7 270/370 (Fake ID needed)
* R7 265

## Unsupported AMD GPUs

### **Navi 2X and Navi 3X**

#### Highest Supported OS: None

While Navi 21 and Navi 23 are supported, Navi 22, Navi 24 and Navi 3X based graphic cards are not at the time of writing.

Unsupported Cards:

* RX 7900 XTX
* RX 7900 XT
* RX 6750 XT
* RX 6700 XT
* RX 6500 XT
* RX 6400

### **Lexa Series**

#### Highest Supported OS: None

While these GPUs may share the same family name as the Polaris GPUs, these cards are drastically different, meaning no support in any version of macOS. Similar to Navi and unsupported NVIDIA GPUs, you'll need to disable the Lexa GPU due to how the VESA drivers that unsupported GPUs run off of break sleep and other functions of macOS. Please refer to the [Disabling GPUs](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/extras/spoof.html) guide for more info.

Unsupported Cards:

* WX 3100
* WX 2100
* RX 550X (Lexa core)
* RX 550 (Lexa core)
* RX 540X
* RX 540

### **AMD APUs (ALL VARIANTS)**

#### Highest Supported OS: None

The integrated GPUs found on mobile and lower end desktop AMD CPUs have unfortunately never had official support with community support quite lacking. While possible to get a display out with some work, graphics acceleration is basically impossible.

Unsupported APUs:

* Vega 11 (Zen)
* Vega 8 (Zen)
* GCN 3 (Excavator Gen 2, Steamroller)
* GCN 2 (Excavator Gen 1, Puma, Puma +)
