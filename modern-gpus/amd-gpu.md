# AMD GPUs

:::tip INFO

Pro/workstation cards, as well as OEM or niche cards, may be missing on this list. If they have a consumer equivalent or use the same core as a consumer card, they should work (albeit possibly needing a fake ID).

**Important note for MSI Navi users**:

* Catalina (10.15) installers and under currently have a VBIOS bug which crashes installers if an MSI Navi card is present. This can be resolved by injecting `ATY,Rom#` in your GPU's DeviceProperties with any value. See here for more details: [Installer not working with 5700XT #901](https://github.com/acidanthera/bugtracker/issues/901)
* MSI's Polaris and Vega line are not affected by this bug.

### Vega 20 series

| Support Status                       ||
| --------------- | ------------------- |
| Latest Support  | Current/Sonoma (14) |
| Initial Support | Mojave (10.14.5)    |

All Vega based dedicated GPUs are natively supported in macOS with Vega 20 GPUs starting in Mojave.

Supported Cards:

### Vega 10 series

| Support Status                       ||
| --------------- | ------------------- |
| Latest Support  | Current/Sonoma (14) |
| Initial Support | High Sierra (10.13) |

Just like with Vega 20, Vega 10 GPUs are natively supported in macOS, though these cards' support starts in High Sierra.

And for those who want to overclock/undervolt, check out [PyVega](https://github.com/corpnewt/PyVega)

The only brand of GPUs to **avoid with Vega 10 is XFX**. The reason is VBIOS communication issues which can't be easily solved with a reference BIOS due to how Vega's powerplay table interacts with the OS and GPU.

### **Polaris 10 and 20 series**

| Support Status                       ||
| --------------- | ------------------- |
| Latest Support  | Current/Sonoma (14) |
| Initial Support | Sierra (10.12.6) |

:::tip INFO

It is unknown if Lexa support was available in 10.12.6 or if it was added in a future version.

:::

Regarding Polaris, almost every model of card is supported as long as itâ€™s running either a Ellesmere or Baffin core. Lower end cards like the RX 550 may run a Lexa core, meaning that spoofing the GPU to a Baffin core RX 550 is required. The only cards that are *not* supported are the RX 580 2048SP and RX 590 GME.

The only brands **you should avoid with the Polaris series would be XFX (460/560 models), PowerColor, HIS and VisionTek** as many users have had bootloader and macOS boot issues. Other users have found fixes/workarounds, though nothing consistent. This seems to be caused by having an odd VBIOS that doesn't communicate well with macOS and the only real solution is flashing another VBIOS, which is not ideal for most users.

:::tip INFO

This is a non-exhaustive list, as there are many Polaris 10 and 20 cards. For a device not listed here, check the device ID and compare it to the list below.

Additionally, a few cards may have device IDs that are uncommon. If your card's device ID does not match what is listed in the table, you may need to spoof the device ID.

### **R7/R9**

#### Highest Supported OS: Monterey (12)

#### Initial Supported OS: Yosemite (10.10)

R7/R9 is also natively supported without too much issue, but we cannot guarantee the success of R5 and R7 cards due to few reports of success with them. Also, be wary that differing from the reference design of these cards has many more issues that require a lot of work to get them to run properly. Sapphire cards are your best bet. Also, the R9 280X/380X are hit or miss on compatibility.

Supported cards:

* R9 Fury X
* R9 Fury
* R9 Nano
* R9 390 (Fake ID needed)
* R9 290X/390X
* R9 290/390 (Fake ID needed)

## Non-Native AMD GPUs

:::warning

As these cards are not supported by the native drivers, we do not recommend purchasing them for use with macOS.

:::

### Navi 22 series

#### Highest Supported OS: Current/Sonoma (14)

Navi 22 series graphics cards are not natively supported by macOS. However, there is a WIP kext, NootRX, that aims to patch the AMD graphics drivers to support Navi 22. It is not fully functional: please see its website for more information.

Supported Cards:

* RX 6700
* RX 6700 XT
* RX 6750
* RX 6750 XT
* RX 6750 GRE

Needed kexts:

* [Lilu.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/Lilu/releases)
* [NootRX.kext](https://chefkissinc.github.io/en/applehax/nootrx/)

### Vega APUs

AMD Vega APUs are not natively supported by macOS. However, there is a WIP kext, NootedRed, that aims to patch the AMD graphics drivers to support Vega APUs. It is not fully functional: please see its website for more information.

Supported iGPUs:

* Vega 3
* Vega 6
* Vega 8
* Vega 9
* Vega 10
* RX Vega 10
* RX Vega 11
* Radeon Graphics (Vega)

These iGPUs can be found in Raven Ridge, Picasso, Renoir, Cezanne, and Barcelo APUs.

## Unsupported AMD GPUs

### Navi 3x series

Navi 3x series (including Navi 31, Navi 32, and Navi 33) graphics cards remain unsupported at the time of writing. As Apple is no longer making Intel Macs and Apple silicon Macs do not support third-party GPUs, it is unlikely that support for these cards will be added in the future.

Unsupported cards include:

* RX 7600
* RX 7600 XT
* RX 7700 XT
* RX 7800 XT
* RX 7900 GRE
* RX 7900 XT
* RX 7900 XTX
* Radeon Pro W7500
* Radeon Pro W7600
* Radeon Pro W7700
* Radeon Pro W7800
* Radeon Pro W7900

### Navi 24 series

While Navi 21 and Navi 23 are already supported, Navi 24 remains unsupported at the time of writing. As Apple is no longer making Intel Macs and Apple silicon Macs do not support third-party GPUs, it is unlikely that support for these cards will be added in the future. NootRX may add support for Navi 24 cards in the future, but they are currently unsupported.

Unsupported cards include:

* RX 6300
* RX 6400
* RX 6500 XT
* Radeon Pro W6300
* Radeon Pro W6400

### AMD APUs (GCN 1-3 and Navi variants)

The integrated GPUs found on mobile and lower end desktop AMD CPUs have unfortunately never had official support with community support quite lacking. While possible to get a display out with some work, graphics acceleration is basically impossible.

Unsupported APUs:

* AMD Radeon Graphics (Zen 4, 5)
* GCN 3 (Excavator Gen 2, Steamroller)
* GCN 2 (Excavator Gen 1, Puma, Puma +)
