# Legacy AMD

So what's this section for? Well, a decent chunk of users have been wondering what the highest supported OS would be for their GPU if the latest isn't supported. The GPUs listed have **theoretical** support but keep in mind that they're not guaranteed to work unless shipped in a [Mac Pro](https://support.apple.com/en-lamr/HT201805). Also keep in mind that this list will likely change as research is done on what device IDs are supported.

Also to note: `InjectATI` may be required for these GPUs.
